# Toolbox
This python package is the corresponding code to the Master Thesis: On the Application of the Competitive Modes Conjecture. Code was developed by Huibert Reijm under supervision of Prof. C. Vuik from the Delft University of Technology and Dr. S. Choudhury from the University of Central Florida. In you have any questions, please contact

The package contains four seperate toolboxes, each designed for a specific role. The file generaltoolbox is used for general everyday numerical analysis, such as differentiation, integration, and plotting of functions.

The file matrixtoolbox is used for numerical analysis involving linear algebra, such as computing Jacobians and solving matrix-vector equations. Note that this module is well-suited for smallermatrices, but is not optimized for larger ones.

The file continuoustoolbox is used for analyzing continuous dynamical systems, including computing Poincare sections, approximating Lyapunov Spectra, and implimenting numerical integration techniques.

The last file discretetoolboxis used for analyzing discrete difference system.
