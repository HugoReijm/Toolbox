# Toolbox
This python package used to correspond to my master thesis, but has since expanded considerably to include code from all branches of numerical mathematics, including calculus, linear algebra, optimization and root-finding, visualization and data analysis, neural networks and other supervised learning techniques, delaunay triangulation and refinement, and a whole host of other things. Enjoy!
